## 👋 Hi!
My name is Krzysztof. I've been passionate about computers since childhood and started programming in elementary school. 
After technical school, I started working as a game programmer. That's how almost a decade of my life went by, but 
lately I've turned towards automation-testing software. I've also become interested in designing electronics and programming my own devices.

## 📍Where am I from?
I was born in Poland in the city of Bydgoszcz. It is a city located on the Brda River, but the district I come from lies on the longest of Polish rivers - the Vistula.
