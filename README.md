I have been passionate about computers since childhood and began programming in elementary school. 
After completing technical school, I started working as a game programmer. 
Almost a decade of my life went by in this field, but recently I have shifted my focus towards automation testing software. 
Additionally, I have developed an interest in designing electronics and programming my own devices.
